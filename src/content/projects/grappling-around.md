## Game Overview
Grappling Around is a 3D platformer game that puts players in control of a character equipped with a versatile grappling gun. The game focuses on fluid movement mechanics, challenging platforming sections, and physics-based gameplay that rewards skill and creativity.

Players must navigate through various levels using their grappling gun to swing across gaps, climb walls, and overcome obstacles. The game emphasizes momentum-based movement, requiring players to master the timing and physics of grappling to achieve optimal speed and efficiency.

### üèÜ Community Reception
The prototype has been well-received by the gaming community, achieving over **3,000 downloads** on itch.io and receiving positive feedback for its innovative grappling mechanics and smooth gameplay experience.

## Core Mechanics

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Grappling Gun System | Physics-based grappling hook with realistic rope dynamics and swing mechanics |
| Momentum-Based Movement | Fluid character movement that maintains physics-accurate momentum and inertia |
| Precision Platforming | Challenging level design that requires skillful use of grappling mechanics |

## Technical Implementation

### Unity Engine & C# Programming
The game was developed using Unity's 3D system with custom C# scripts for character movement, grappling mechanics, and physics interactions.

*   Custom character controller with state machine pattern
*   Physics-based rope simulation using Unity's Joint3D components

### Physics & Movement Systems
The core grappling mechanic utilizes Unity's physics engine to create realistic rope behavior and swinging dynamics.

*   Line rendering for visual rope representation
*   Raycast-based grapple point detection

## Development Challenges

### Physics-Based Rope Mechanics
**Challenge:** Creating realistic rope physics that felt responsive and intuitive to players.
**Solution:** Implemented a hybrid approach using Unity's Joint3D system combined with custom algorithms for rope tension and swing dynamics, achieving a balance between realism and gameplay feel.
