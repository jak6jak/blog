My year as a McDonald's crew member, though often a test of endurance against monotony, 
offered an unexpectedly profound education in operational efficiency. 
As an aspiring computer science major, 
I found myself constantly drawing parallels between the rapid-fire 
demands of fast-food service and the elegant principles of concurrent and 
asynchronous programming. This experience transformed a mundane job into a living case study, 
revealing how a system as seemingly simple, yet inherently complex, as serving food can be 
meticulously organized and optimized for peak performance. I'm excited to go into the minute 
details of McDonald's drive-thru operations, illustrating how these real-world processes mirror 
the design of robust software systems.
## The Drive-Thru Process
The restaurant kitchen is organized into two parts. the frontline and the backline. 
The frontline was responsible for customer facing roles such as receiving payment, organizing 
and distributing food and drinks. They also are responsible for any error handling for which 
they would pass on to the backline to remake. The backline was responsible for the actual 
cooking and putting together of all food except for french fries. Personally 
I spent 100% of my time as frontline crew member so that is what I will focus on in this post.
## Roles and responsibilities:
The front line consisted of numerous responsibilities that needed to be strategically distributed among team members to maintain efficiency. Rather than having each person handle everything, McDonald's optimizes operations by assigning specific roles to different positions.
